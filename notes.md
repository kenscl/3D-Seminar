# Vio
 - small drift < 0.2 % in trajectory
# RPGO performance 
 - relativly insensitive to parameter choice when using PCM
# 3D mesh performance 
## RMSE 
 - Performance tested on 6 tests  
 - Messured both Multi frame mesh and Global mesh
 - Muti frame RMSE between 0.374 and 0.530 m with median of 0.482
 - Global between 0.353 and 0.480 m with median of 0.384 m
 - Global better than Multi frame mesh in 4 cases, ranging between 12 and 24% better, when outperformed less than 3% dif3% difference
 - maby include completness 
# Semantic reconstruction
 - test by use of simulator 
 - small geometric and semantic errors with bundled raycasting, while dense stereo introduces notable errors, especially in texture-less areas like walls. 

# conclusion
 - c++ Library for things
 - four modules wich are modular and generally perform adequatly/outperform other solutions
