## RMSE 
 - Performance tested on 6 tests  
 - Messured both Multi frame mesh and Global mesh
 - Muti frame RMSE between 0.374 and 0.530 m with median of 0.482
 - Global between 0.353 and 0.480 m with median of 0.384 m
 - Global better than Multi frame mesh in 4 cases, ranging between 12 and 24% better, when outperformed less than 3% dif3% difference
